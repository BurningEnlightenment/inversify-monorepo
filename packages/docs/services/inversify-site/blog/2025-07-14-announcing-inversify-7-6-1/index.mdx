We're excited to announce InversifyJS 7.6.1! This release brings enhanced container hierarchy features and improved decorator capabilities.

## Chained Resolution Mode

One of the most significant additions in this release is **chained resolution mode** for container hierarchies. Previously, when resolving multiple services with `getAll()`, InversifyJS would only look in the first container that had bindings for that service identifier.

Now, with the `chained: true` option, you can collect bindings from **all levels** of the container hierarchy:

<CodeBlock language="ts">{containerApiGetAllChainedSource}</CodeBlock>

## Enhanced @multiInject Decorator

The `@multiInject` decorator now supports chained resolution, allowing you to inject services from all levels of the container hierarchy. This is particularly useful in plugin architectures or modular applications:

```ts
class PluginManager {
  constructor(
    @multiInject('Plugin', { chained: true })
    private plugins: Plugin[]
  ) {
    // This will include plugins from both parent and child containers
  }
}
```

This enhancement makes it easy to collect implementations from different container levels without manually calling `getAll()` with chained options.

## API Consistency Improvements

We've updated the Container API to use `GetAllOptions` for `getAll()` and `getAllAsync()` methods, providing better consistency and access to advanced features like chained resolution.

The binding syntax has also been refined with more consistent parameter naming across constraint methods.
