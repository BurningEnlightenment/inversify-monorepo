# DI Hierarchy

InversifyJS is a popular library for implementing inversion of control (IoC) and dependency injection (DI) in TypeScript applications. It supports hierarchical dependency injection, which can be a powerful tool in complex applications.

With InversifyJS's hierarchical injection system, you can create a hierarchy of containers where each container can have a parent container. This allows for better organization and separation of concerns in your application.

When a dependency needs to be injected, InversifyJS starts by looking in the current container for a binding. If the binding is not found, it moves up the hierarchy to the parent container and continues the search. This process continues until a binding is found or the top-level parent container is reached.

:::warning

Found bindings might be discarded if their constraints are not met. For example, if a named binding is found in the child container for the requested service, that binding overrides parent bindings even if this binding is later discarded in a non-named resolution request.

:::

By using InversifyJS's hierarchical injection system, you can easily manage complex dependencies and keep your code clean and modular. It provides a flexible and scalable solution for handling dependencies in your TypeScript applications.
