Whenever a singleton scoped service is unbound, the deactivation event is dispatched. A deactivation handler receives a resolved value and returns nothing.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{containerApiOnDeactivationSource}</CodeBlock>

It's possible to add a deactivation handler in multiple ways

- Adding the handler to the [container](../../api/container.mdx#ondeactivation).
- Adding the handler to a [binding](../../api/binding-syntax.mdx#ondeactivation).
- Adding the handler to the class through the [preDestroy decorator](../../api/decorator.mdx#predestroy).

Handlers added to the container are the first ones to be resolved. Any handler added to a child container is called before the ones added to their parent. Relevant bindings from the container are called next and finally the `preDestroy` method is called. In the example above, relevant bindings are those bindings bound to the unbinded "Destroyable" service identifier.
