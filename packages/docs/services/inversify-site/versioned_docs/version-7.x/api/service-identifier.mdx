# ServiceIdentifier

## Overview

`ServiceIdentifier` is a fundamental type that identifies services within the InversifyJS dependency injection container. It serves as a key for registering, locating, and retrieving services, acting as a bridge between service registration and resolution.

## Definition

`ServiceIdentifier` is a union type that can be one of:

```typescript
type ServiceIdentifier<TInstance = unknown> =
  | string
  | symbol
  | Newable<TInstance>
  | AbstractNewable<TInstance>;
```

Where `Newable` is defined as:

```typescript
type Newable<
  TInstance = unknown,
  TArgs extends unknown[] = any[],
> = new (...args: TArgs) => TInstance;
```

## Usage

`ServiceIdentifier` is used throughout the InversifyJS API for:

1. **Service Registration**: Binding services to the container
2. **Service Resolution**: Retrieving services from the container
3. **Service Configuration**: Setting activation/deactivation handlers

### Examples

```typescript
// Using a class as a service identifier (most common)
container.bind(UserService).toSelf();

// Using a string as a service identifier
container.bind("IUserService").to(UserService);

// Using a symbol as a service identifier
const userServiceId: ServiceIdentifier<UserService> = Symbol("UserService");
container.bind(userServiceId).to(UserService);

// Resolving with a class identifier
const firstUserService = container.get(UserService);

// Resolving with a string identifier
const secondUserService = container.get("IUserService");

// Resolving with a symbol identifier
const thirdUserService = container.get(userServiceId);
```

:::info[Type Inference support]

When using generics with `ServiceIdentifier<T>`, TypeScript can infer the resolved type. In the example above, `thirdUserService` is automatically typed as `UserService` because `userServiceId` was defined as `ServiceIdentifier<UserService>`.
