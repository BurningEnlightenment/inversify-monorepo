# Dependency inversion

To apply the dependency inversion principle, you can use injection symbols:

<CodeBlock language="ts">{dependencyInversionSource}</CodeBlock>

By using symbols, you can provide interface implementations in a way that the dependent class is not aware of the dependency implementation details.

:::note

Although symbols are recommended for this purpose, InversifyJS also supports using Classes and string literals as service identifiers.
