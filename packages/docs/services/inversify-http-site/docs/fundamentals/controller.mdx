# Controller

Controllers group request handlers for a feature area. A controller defines a base path and one or more route handlers using method decorators like `Get`, `Post`, etc.

Key points

- Annotate classes with `@Controller('/base')`
- Add route handlers with decorators such as `@Get()`, `@Post()`, `@Put()`, ...
- Controllers can have guards, middleware, and pipes at class or method level
- Bind controllers to your Inversify container so the adapter can find them

:::info[Controller and injectable decorators]
  You do not need to add `@injectable()`; the `@Controller()` decorator already applies it for you
:::

## Basic example

A minimal controller with one route:

<CodeBlock language="ts">{controllerApiBasicsSource}</CodeBlock>

## Registering a controller

Controllers are discovered via reflect metadata but must also be registered in your container. Bind your controller class and choose a scope.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{controllerApiRegisterSource}</CodeBlock>

The adapter builds routes from controller metadata at runtime when you call `build()` on your chosen server adapter. See the controller example integration test for a full end‑to‑end setup.
